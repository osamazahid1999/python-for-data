# Python for Data Learning Journey

This repository tracks my 30-day journey to learn Python for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for daily practice and projects
- `projects/` → End-to-end mini and final data projects
- `README.md` → This file — outlines my progress, tools, and milestones

## Tools Used
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

# Python for Data Learning Journey




## Day 1 – Getting Started

- Created initial project structure (`README.md`, `notebooks/`, `projects/`)
- Learned about Python basics:
  - Variables
  - Data types (int, float, str, bool)
  - Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries
- Wrote first Jupyter Notebook in `notebooks/day1_basics.ipynb`
